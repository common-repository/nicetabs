== Usage ==

Since there is no setting in this plugin, you can easily put shortcode to your post / page

here's the shortcodes

[tTab tab_id="tab1,tab2,tab3" tab_title="Title 1,Title 2,Title 3"]

this shortcode will generate the title of the tabs. you can generate as many tabs as you need, by putting comma separated value to the tab_id and tab_title

the content of the tabs structured like this :

[sTab]

    [cTab id="tab1"] text / html content [/cTab]

    [cTab id="tab2"] text / html content [/cTab]

    [cTab id="tab2"] text / html content [/cTab]

[eTab]

please note the id of cTab must match to tTab's tab_id.
